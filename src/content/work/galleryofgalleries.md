## About 

The Gallery of Galleries website was built with the idea in mind to create a directory for Galleries within the small island Sri Lanka. It contains features ranging from the ability to leave reviews on the various art galleries, an exhibition timeline you can view and then use to visit exhibitions around the island , a list of all the galleries , the history of sri lankan art along with a Emerging AI Art display Gallery . The website also contains a fully functional backend allowing admins to edit and alter the variable aspects within the website.The website was built as a submission to fulfill the requirements of our 1st Year 2nd Semester Web Group project.
