# CMB Delivery Services

CMB Delivery Services â€“ where a smooth and easy-to-use app meets a strong and dependable system, carefully designed to optimize and simplify the delivery process. Our user-friendly system helps administrators with efficient delivery management capabilities, allowing them to add deliveries by specifying items and destinations. After registration, designated drivers can log into their accounts to view their assigned deliveries and their respective statuses.

Behind the scenes, our authorized staff gain access to the backend database. This administrative control ensures efficient management of customer orders. From adjusting delivery addresses to completely removing orders, the process is made smooth and easy with just a simple click. For drivers, a dedicated interface provides a quick overview of deliveries that are in progress, assigned, and already completed. Each delivery is associated with a unique ID, ensuring precision and organization throughout the process.

At the core of CMB Delivery Services, our dedication to ensuring seamless operations and customer satisfaction takes top priority, driving every aspect of our service. This assignment was created as a submission for the 1st Year 2nd Semester OOP Programming in C# group project.

### Splash Screen

When the application is launched, a splash screen appears, displaying two buttons: "Login as Admin" and "Login as Driver". Each button directs users to their separate login interfaces designed for administrators and drivers.

### Dashboard

The administrator has the capability to monitor ongoing deliveries and add new ones. Similarly, they can also observe the number of existing drivers as needed. Delivery statuses of all active deliveries are also shown within a readily updated pie chart where data is fetched from the database. Furthermore, a logout feature is also accessible.

### Status of Delivery

Upon initiating a new delivery, the driver gains the ability to indicate various stages of progress. By utilizing designated buttons, the driver can confirm order receipt, baggage pickup, ongoing delivery status, and finally, successful baggage delivery. The driver won't be able to go back after pressing a status option and they won't be able skip any status options. The main reason is as you can see below, we have only enabled the required status button.
